# Cleanup cycles

The active objective is to commit the verified work, then repeatedly inspect,
simplify, test, review and commit the next useful change. Each cycle must remove
verified complexity or fix a concrete defect. Do not manufacture churn to keep
the loop busy. Production remains strictly read-only; pushes and deployments
are outside this objective.

## Cycle 0 — Commit the two verified passes

- Scope: D01–D14 plus the second simplification pass recorded in this folder.
- Evidence: 2,926 unit tests, 132 first-pass Postgres regression cases, current
  builds/contracts and second-pass local model smoke; details remain in the
  individual pass records.
- Review: independent durable-operation and public-surface reviews found no
  actionable issues. The surface review also passed 42 focused tests and confirmed
  exact before/after parity for all 131 default grants.
- Exclusions: unrelated image-generation and background-tool-job work, plus
  generated reporting artifacts. Preserve those files and their author's commits.
- Commit: `ca5a689d` — `refactor(core): consolidate durable ownership and remove obsolete paths`.
- State: committed locally; not pushed or deployed.

## Cycle 1 — Consolidate catalog-backed CLI help

The host CLI pre-registers handwritten help-only commands even though
`registerCommandRouteHelpCommands` already projects catalog routes and skips
existing operator commands. Inspect and remove the redundant registrars while
preserving native callbacks, option parsing and command discovery. Compare actual
help/JSON output before and after; do not create another command inventory.

- Result: deleted 13 help-only registrars and their app wiring: 834 fewer
  production lines, with 10 net test lines added. The existing catalog supplies
  their 60 routes; native operator callbacks and image CLI remain intact.
- Evidence: 180 before/after comparisons preserved leaf JSON help, text help and
  transport errors. All 239 focused command/package/schema tests passed. Fifteen
  real CLI help subprocesses passed against an unusable database URL, including
  generated help beneath operator groups. Typecheck, import law, shim generation,
  prompt contracts and diff checks passed.
- Review: independent final review found no blockers and reran 40 command/help
  and schema-gate tests successfully. Tests protect complete descriptor output,
  native callback/options retention through repeated registration, and DB-free
  generated help. No references to the deleted modules remain.
- State: reviewed and committed locally with this cycle; not pushed or deployed.

## Cycle 2 — Simplify browser action completion

Six browser page actions repeat baseline capture, settling and changed-snapshot
rendering. Consolidate that sequence locally while preserving each action's
Playwright calls, progress order, popup behavior, target validation and scope
invalidation. Reuse the existing timeout helper without weakening dirty-session
closure after timeout. Remove trivial naming adapters only where direct calls
remain clear.

- State: implementation in progress; terminal snapshot/rendering simplifications
  are being investigated separately for the following cycle.
